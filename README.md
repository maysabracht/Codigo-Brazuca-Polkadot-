# Polkadot Gas Price Calculator ‚õΩÔ∏è

This project is a **Polkadot Gas Price Calculator** developed as part of a Web3 education course offered by **C√≥digo Brazuca** in collaboration with the **Polkadot Blockchain Academy**. The goal of the project is to simulate gas prices for Polkadot transactions.

## Project Overview üìñ
The project involves calculating gas prices for Polkadot transactions using the following:
- **HTML & CSS**: Provided as a foundation for the user interface (UI)
- **JavaScript**: Developed and enhanced by students to handle logic and interactivity

## Demo üåê
You can view and interact with the live version of this project here:

[Polkadot Gas Price Calculator - Live Demo](https://maysabracht.github.io/Codigo-Brazuca-Polkadot-/)

The live version is hosted on this branch for easy access, while all the course files are actually in the **main branch** of this repository.

## Students have contributed by building out the **JavaScript functionality** to:
- Gas price calculation
- Currency conversion
- Transaction value validation
- Transaction history

These improvements have added interactivity and dynamic features to the calculator, allowing users to calculate and visualize Polkadot transaction costs effectively.

## Project Files üìÇ
The project files are organized within this repository for easy access:
- **HTML & CSS**: Base files for structure and styling.
- **JavaScript**: The code developed by me, including features like real-time validation and transaction history.

While the live version is available on this branch, all course files are in the **main branch** of this repository.

## How to Use the Calculator ‚öôÔ∏è
1. Enter the **transaction value** in the provided input field.
2. Choose the **currency** to see the conversion and gas price calculation.
3. The **transaction history** will update with each new calculation.
4. Real-time **validation** ensures the transaction value is greater than zero before submission.

## About the Course üéì
This project is part of a broader Web3 course that covers blockchain technologies, Polkadot, and Web3 principles, including hands-on exercises in **JavaScript**, **Rust**, and **Polkadot development**.
